# Import and analysis

How tracks get from the music library into the database, ready to air. Delivered in [M1](roadmap/m1-import-analysis.md).

```
music library ──► scanner (heron-api) ──► tracks ──► analysis_jobs ──► heron-analyzer ──► track_analysis
  (read-only)       tags, fingerprint                  (queue)          decode, measure
```

Heron **never modifies your files**: the library is mounted read-only.

## Scanner

The scanner runs inside `heron-api`:

- **When:** at startup, after file system events (debounced 5 s), and every `HERON_SCAN_INTERVAL` seconds (default 3600) as a safety net for file systems that do not report changes (NFS, SMB). Set `HERON_LIBRARY_WATCH=false` where watching does not work.
- **What it picks up:** `mp3 m4a mp4 aac flac ogg oga opus wav aif aiff`, case-insensitive. Hidden files and folders are skipped, including macOS `._` resource forks.
- **Change detection:** each track stores the file's size and mtime. An unchanged file is not opened again, so rescanning 1,000 unchanged tracks takes under 100 ms locally.
- **New or changed files:** the scanner reads the tags (title, artist, album, duration, via `lofty`) and a **fingerprint**: BLAKE3 of the size plus the first and last 64 KiB. Reading whole files would double the I/O of an import, which hurts on network shares.
- **Files still being copied:** files modified less than `HERON_IMPORT_SETTLE` seconds ago (default 5) are left for the next scan.
- **Moves and renames:** a new path whose fingerprint matches a track that vanished is treated as a move. The track keeps its ID, categories, history and analysis.
- **Deleted files:** the track is marked `missing_since` and keeps its categories and history. It comes back if the file reappears. If the library directory is empty while tracks are known, nothing is marked missing: an unmounted volume must not "lose" the library.
- **Paths** are stored relative to the library root with `/` separators, so every service can mount the library wherever it likes.
- **Changed files** lose their analysis and are analyzed again.

After (and during) a scan, every present track whose analysis is missing, made by another algorithm version, or made with other settings, is queued.

## Job queue

`analysis_jobs` in MariaDB, claimed with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so any number of workers and analyzer replicas can share it. See `heron_analysis::jobs`.

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| Transient error (file unreadable, database down) | Retried after 30 s, then 60 s; 3 attempts in total |
| Broken file (cannot be decoded) | Failed at once, and any older analysis of the track is removed. Not retried while the file is unchanged |
| File changed during analysis, or differs from what the scanner recorded | Result dropped, job postponed by 30 s without counting an attempt. Network shares report modification times lazily, so a file can still be copying after it looked settled |
| Worker crashed | Its jobs are reclaimed after a 5 min lease, or immediately when the same instance restarts |
| Analyzer shut down | Running jobs are put back without counting the attempt |

Re-analysis happens automatically when `ALGORITHM_VERSION` in `heron-analysis` is bumped (algorithm or decoder changes) or when the analysis settings change (their fingerprint is stored as `params_hash`).

## Analyzer

`heron-analyzer` runs `HERON_ANALYZER_WORKERS` workers in parallel, by default the number of CPUs minus one, so the engine always keeps a core on small machines such as a Raspberry Pi.

Decoding uses Symphonia:

| Format | Status |
|---|---|
| MP3 (MPEG-1/2 layers I, II, III) | Supported, including large ID3v2 tags (embedded cover art) |
| M4A / MP4: AAC-LC, ALAC | Supported |
| FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, WAV, AIFF | Supported |
| HE-AAC (AAC+) in M4A | Not supported by Symphonia's AAC decoder |
| Opus | Not supported by Symphonia; needs libopus (BSD), planned with the engine |
| MP3 inside a WAV (RIFF) container | Not supported, reported as failed |

Decoding is gapless (encoder delay and padding removed). MP3s with a broken Xing/LAME header, whose frame count makes gapless trimming drop everything, are decoded again without gapless trimming. Decoded audio peaking above +12 dBTP is rejected as corrupt: playing it would be dangerous.

## Measurements

Audio is measured in **5 ms frames** (RMS of all channels), which is the time resolution of every detected point.

| Field | How |
|---|---|
| `duration_ms` | Decoded samples |
| `integrated_lufs` | EBU R128 integrated loudness (`ebur128`) |
| `true_peak_db` | Highest true peak across channels, dBTP |
| `cue_in_ms` | First non-silent frame, ignoring blips |
| `cue_out_ms` | End of the last non-silent frame, ignoring blips, or the start of a long internal silence |
| `has_internal_silence` | A silence longer than `max_internal_silence_ms` ends the track there (hidden tracks) |
| `fade_out_start_ms` | Crossfade point, see below |

A track with no audible content has `cue_out_ms <= cue_in_ms` and is never played.

### What counts as silence

A frame is silent when it is below **both**:

- the relative threshold: `start_threshold_db` (−20 dB) at the start, `end_threshold_db` (−24 dB) at the end, measured from the track's integrated loudness;
- the absolute ceiling `silence_ceiling_dbfs` (−50 dBFS).

The ceiling exists because relative thresholds alone cut real music. On a test library of about 1,800 real tracks (progressive rock, metal), thresholds relative to loudness alone trimmed more than 3 s from 171 tracks: soft intros of loud masters were taken for silence (for example 55 s of *Matmos* by Amplifier, 20 s of *Perfume River* by Fish). With the ceiling, those intros are kept.

On the full test library (4,364 tracks), 120 tracks (2.8 %) still start more than 3 s in. Some are inaudible fade-ins (the first 33 s of *Matmos* rise from −85 dBFS), but others are deliberate quiet intros between −60 and −50 dBFS: the wind of *One Of These Days* (Pink Floyd, 27 s trimmed), the nature sounds of *Close To The Edge* (Yes, 23 s). A −60 dBFS ceiling would keep most of them; see the [open questions](open-questions.md).

**Blips** (isolated sounds of `blip_max_ms` or less, 10 ms by default, such as clicks) are treated as silence.

### Crossfade point

`fade_out_start_ms` is where the next track starts:

1. Find the end of the last frame louder than `fade_trigger_db` (−15 dB from the integrated loudness) before the cue-out.
2. Keep it between `fade_max_ms` (2,500 ms) and `fade_min_ms` (150 ms) before the cue-out.

So a long quiet outro is crossfaded at most 2.5 s before its end, and an abrupt ending still gets a 150 ms overlap.

## Settings

Stored as JSON under the `analysis` name in the `settings` table; missing fields take the defaults. Changing them re-analyzes every track.

| Setting | Default |
|---|---|
| `start_threshold_db` | −20 |
| `end_threshold_db` | −24 |
| `silence_ceiling_dbfs` | −50 |
| `blip_max_ms` | 10 |
| `max_internal_silence_ms` | 15,000 |
| `fade_trigger_db` | −15 |
| `fade_min_ms` | 150 |
| `fade_max_ms` | 2,500 |

To try settings on files without touching the database:

```sh
HERON_ANALYSIS_SETTINGS='{"silence_ceiling_dbfs": -60}' \
  cargo run --release -p heron-analysis --example analyze -- path/to/*.mp3
```

## Status

`GET /api/v1/library/status` returns the track counts (present, missing, analyzed, silent), the job queue and the last scan report. The web page shows it.

Metrics: `heron_library_scans_total`, `heron_library_scan_duration_seconds`, `heron_library_files` (heron-api); `heron_analysis_jobs_total{result}`, `heron_analysis_seconds`, `heron_analysis_audio_ms_total` (heron-analyzer).
