//! The 10-band graphic EQ of the decks.
//!
//! A low shelf at 60 Hz, eight peaking bands, a high shelf at 16 kHz: the
//! designs of Robert Bristow-Johnson's *Audio EQ Cookbook* ([`Coefficients`]),
//! run as state-variable filters ([`Svf`]), which change gain smoothly. Each
//! peaking band is as wide as the distances to its neighbours, and the filter
//! gains are solved from the sliders ([`filter_gains`]) so the curve meets
//! every slider at its band. Gains glide to new settings instead of stepping,
//! and a bypassed EQ is not computed at all.
//!
//! [`GraphicEq::process`] runs on the audio thread: it never allocates.
//! [`filter_gains`] does not allocate either, but runs on the control thread.
