# Chaos tests (M3): breaks a running Compose stack in the ways a station
# breaks, while listening to the stream, and checks each time that the air
# stays on or comes back by itself:
#
#   1. MariaDB stopped;
#   2. heron-api stopped, and the queue emptied: the fallback directory plays;
#   3. Icecast restarted;
#   4. the files of queued tracks deleted;
#   5. a silent file queued: the silence watchdog skips it;
#   6. heron-engine restarted, cleanly then killed: it resumes the track on air.
#
#   docker compose --profile icecast up -d --wait
#   scripts/chaos-test.sh
#
# Needs tracks in the library and in the fallback directory, curl, and
# Docker (ffmpeg in a container listens to the stream). Takes about 10 min.
